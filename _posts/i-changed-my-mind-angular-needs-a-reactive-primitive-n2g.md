title: 'I changed my mind. Angular needs a reactive primitive'
excerpt: 'Angular developers have waited 7 years for better integration with RxJS, but this doesn''t seem to be happening. This made me angry at first, but after a lot of thinking and talking with other developers, I now believe that a reactive primitive could provide an overall better developer experience than just better RxJS support, even for the most diehard RxJS fans.'

Angular developers have waited 7 years for better integration with RxJS, but this doesn''t seem to be happening.
